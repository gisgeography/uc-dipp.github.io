#### 12 - 1:20pm, Harris Room 289A, Lunch supplied

Join us for a conversation on **predictive analytics** with **Brett Goldstein, former Chief Data Officer and Chief Information Officer for the City of Chicago**. In 2011, Mayor Rahm Emanuel appointed Brett to be Chicago's first municipal Chief Data Officer in 2011. In 2012, Brett also assumed the role of Chief Information Officer. In these roles, he led successful efforts to use data to improve the way city government serves its residents and established one of the largest open data programs in the country. 

Brett will discuss his path to becoming Chicago's Chief Data Officer, how government agencies are using data today and what the future of data analytics holds for the public sector. **The event will include lunch**, is open to all Harris students and is sponsored by the **Data in Public Policy (DiPP)** student group.

Prior to becoming Chicago's Chief Data Officer and Chief Information Officer, Brett was an early employee of Open Table, a Chicago beat cop, and the director of the Chicago Police Department's Predictive Analytics Group. Brett 
currently serves as the inaugural Senior Fellow in Urban Science at the Harris School.
