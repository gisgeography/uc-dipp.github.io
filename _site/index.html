    <h4>6pm, Promontory Point Park, Bring food to share</h4>

<p>While the rest of society said goodbye to summer this weekend, we have another month left. Make it count!  
Come join us at the DiPP Welcome Back Potluck.  We’ll have a couple small grills going, so bring stuff to grill and side dishes to share.</p>

    <p>Remember that Hack Harris will be moving to Harris starting tomorrow. We&#39;ll be in room 140C this week, with a start time of 6pm. This should give all you working folk time to get down to Hyde Park from your real person jobs, easing the transition to becoming a student again. </p>

<p>This week we&#39;ll cover mapping in CartoDB. We&#39;ll have three or four data sets picked out from the City of Chicago&#39;s open data portal for you all to play with, hopefully in small groups. </p>

<p>If you know any incoming students — or even if you just see one standing scared in the cafe of Harris, confused and unsure about how to find, well, basically anything in that building — point them to Hack Harris. </p>

    <p>If you don&#39;t want to think about how summer is ending, ignore this post. But if you like putting things on your calendar weeks in advance, make sure to note the Hack Harris beginning of the school year potluck. </p>

<p>It&#39;ll be on Wednesday (duh), 9/24 in Hyde Park at 6pm. We&#39;ll remind you again in a few weeks. This will be during orientation week and incoming students are invited. Alums, if you dare to return to Hyde Park, we&#39;d very much welcome your beautiful faces, too! </p>

    <p>I think we set a new HaHa attendance record this past week! Thank you to all the Harris alums who joined us to learn SQL from Jonathan. And to repeat (or maybe state for the first time): Alums, friends, and frenemies are very much welcome at all Hack Harris events. </p>

<p>This week we&#39;ll dip our toes into JavaScript. HTML organizes web pages, CSS makes them pretty, and JS makes them interactive. Want to make fun interactive maps <a href="http://derekeder.com/searchable_map_template/">like this</a> with open data? Well, you&#39;ll need to know JavaScript. So come get an intro to it this Wednesday @ 5:30 pm at 16 W. Randolph (Argo Tea). </p>

    <h4 id="12---1:20pm,-harris-room-289a,-lunch-supplied">12 - 1:20pm, Harris Room 289A, Lunch supplied</h4>

<p>Join us for a conversation on <strong>predictive analytics</strong> with <strong>Brett Goldstein, former Chief Data Officer and Chief Information Officer for the City of Chicago</strong>. In 2011, Mayor Rahm Emanuel appointed Brett to be Chicago&#39;s first municipal Chief Data Officer in 2011. In 2012, Brett also assumed the role of Chief Information Officer. In these roles, he led successful efforts to use data to improve the way city government serves its residents and established one of the largest open data programs in the country. </p>

<p>Brett will discuss his path to becoming Chicago&#39;s Chief Data Officer, how government agencies are using data today and what the future of data analytics holds for the public sector. <strong>The event will include lunch</strong>, is open to all Harris students and is sponsored by the <strong>Data in Public Policy (DiPP)</strong> student group.</p>

<p>Prior to becoming Chicago&#39;s Chief Data Officer and Chief Information Officer, Brett was an early employee of Open Table, a Chicago beat cop, and the director of the Chicago Police Department&#39;s Predictive Analytics Group. Brett 
currently serves as the inaugural Senior Fellow in Urban Science at the Harris School.</p>
