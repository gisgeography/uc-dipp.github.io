<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I am a second year Masters student at the <a href=http://harris.uchicago.edu/>Harris School</a>, earning a MS in Environmental Science and Policy. I work at the <a href=https://www.rdcep.org>Center for Robust Decision Making on Climate and Energy Policy </a>, on integrated assessment models to attempt to quantify the economic consequences of climate change. I am also a co-chair of the <a href=http://harris.uchicago.edu/applied-experience/student-organizations/cepa>Chicago Environmental Policy Association</a> at the Harris School, and am an active member of DIPP. 

<br>

I am interested in using quantitative methods to help firms understand their operation's impact on the environment: using life cycle analyses to improve manufacturing methods and materials, promoting ethical sourcing, and reducing supply chain risk. More broadly, I like using data to solve problems related to energy efficiency, climate change, and operations research.
