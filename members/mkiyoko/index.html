 <p>In DiPP, I'd like to acquire computational analysis skills and make friends who persue public good as a policy maker!</p>

<div><em><h1>Introduction</h1></em></div>
 <p>I came from Japan, and previously I was in charge of making IT policy. I notice the importance of data analysis for policy making, and now I'm here. I'm so happy to work with you in Harris!!</p>
