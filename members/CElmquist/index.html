  <p> Hi, my name is Candace, and I am a first year at the <a href="http://harris.uchicago.edu/">Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago</a>. I am one of the few students in my cohort who decided to immediately transition from their undergraduate to graduate career. My background from my undergraduate institution, <a href="https://www.umich.edu">University of Michigan</a>, is in political science and crime policy.</p>
  <br>

  <br>
  <p>A few weeks ago I went on a two week train trip across Northwestern America. </p>

  The train trip started out as a 2-day long journey on Amtrak's <em>California Zephyr</em>. Upon arriving in Salt Lake City, we spent two days learning about the Mormon heritage and exploring the city. Some people on our trip enjoyed visiting the Family Search library, which houses over<b> 2.4 million</b> rolls of microfilmed genealogical records!

  We then travelled on a bus through the grand tetons and stopped at the Grand Teton National Park Visitors Center.

  However, the highlight of the trip was definitely the four days spent at Yellowstone. We actually stayed inside of park, in modified cabins inside Canyon Village.
