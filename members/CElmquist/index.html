  <p> Hi, my name is Candace, and I am a first year at the <a href="http://harris.uchicago.edu/">Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago</a>. I am one of the few students in my cohort who decided to immediately transition from their undergraduate to graduate career. My background from my undergraduate institution, <a href="https://www.umich.edu">University of Michigan</a>, is in political science, crime policy, and education policy.</p>
