    Aaron Politsky here.

  <p>
    Let's see...
    Hack-wise, I built a web app in Rails called <a href="http://www.dunkbonds.com">DUNKbonds</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's a prediction market, but for people's personal goals, such as:
    <ul>
      <li>losing weight
      <li>shooting par
      <li>or (ahem) dunking a basketball
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm digging the Hack Harris thing.
