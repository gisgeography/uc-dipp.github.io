	<p>I'm Alex Warofka a first-year MPP student at the <a href="http://harrisschool.uchicago.edu/">Harris School of Public Policy</a> and research associate at the UCLA <a href="http://ccpr.ucla.edu/">California Center for Population Research</a>. I recently completed a Fulbright Fellowship in Japan, studying the economics and human rights impacts of Japan’s Industrial Trainee and Technical Internship Programme.</p>
	<p>I completed my undergraduate degree in economics in the US at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio with concentrations in finance and Japanese language. I have also studied at Peking University, Kyoto University, and the London School of Economics. I continue to assist the Department of Economics at CWRU on several projects, including an ongoing effort to map the US automotive supply chain.</p>
	<p>When not busy with my research pursuits, I enjoy travelling, photography, and hiking. I’ve lived in five countries and explored three dozen more. I’m equally at home relaxing in a New York high-rise or working with NGOs in the remote villages of rural Bangladesh. I’m particularly fond of embarking on ill-advised adventures, such as the <a href="http://www.theadventurists.com/the-adventures/mongol-rally">Mongol Rally</a> and excursions to members of the Axis of Evil.</p>
	<p>I am proficient in English, Japanese, and conversational Mandarin.</p>
