<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>I'm excited to serve on the DiPP exec board this year. If you have any suggestions or ideas for DiPP career events, let me know!</p>

<p>I am a second year MPP student at the <a href=http://harris.uchicago.edu/>Harris School</a>.  
I am especially interested in domestic health policy and quantitative research methods. Originally from the Washington DC area,
I am enjoying the opportunity to explore Chicago!</p>

<h2>Experience</h2>

During my first year at Harris, I worked as a research assistant at the University of Chicago's Center for Health and the Social Sciences.  I worked with the director of the Method Core helping to organize and promote the data they manage. 

Prior to coming to Harris, I spent three years as a paralegal with <a href=http://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/bureaus-offices/bureau-competition>the Bureau of Competition of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission</a>. There I helped investigate and litigate antitrust cases.
