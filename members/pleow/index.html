<br><blockquote>Poverty has risen dramatically, and become increasingly concentrated, in suburban Virginian towns in like Dale City since the year 2000. In the same timeframe the average commute has increased by 84%. The mismatched geography of jobs intensifies the effects of inequality in these newly-poor suburbs.</blockquote></br>
