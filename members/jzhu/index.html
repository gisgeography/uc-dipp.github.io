<p>I am Julia Zhu.  I am currently a first year MPP student at the <a href="http://harris.uchicago.edu">Harris School of Public Policy</a>.  
My areas of interest include inequality and child and family policy, and ways in which the latter may be used to address entrenched poverty.</p>

<p>I enjoy running and am currently training for a half marathon in December.  I attended the University of Chicago as an undergraduate (AB '09) and am so happy to be back!</p>
