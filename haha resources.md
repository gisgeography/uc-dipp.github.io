Suggested datasets from the [Chicago data portal](http://data.cityofchicago.org):

* [Crime reports in Chicago, August 2014]()
    * You may need to reduce the number of columns and/or rows to fit it into CartoDB
    * Good variables to cluster on: `primary_type`, `arrest`, `location_description`
* [Food inspections in Chicago, 2014 to date]()
    * You will need to reduce the size to fit it into CartoDB
    * Interesting variables to use: `facility_type`, `risk` (predicted risk of failing inspection), `results`
*
