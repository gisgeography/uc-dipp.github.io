<p>Data in Public Policy (DIPP) is a student organization at the <a href="http://harrisschool.uchicago.edu">University of Chicago Harris School for Public Policy</a> founded to build analytical skills and expertise among Harris students in open-source data platforms, foster a professional relationship with the data and tech community in Chicago, and to generally serve as a resource for Harris students interested in the intersection of data and public policy.  Created informally in Fall 2012, DIPP launched as an official Harris Student Organization in Fall 2013.</p>
